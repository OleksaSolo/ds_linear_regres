Classification and assessment of model performance. Linear regression: retraining and regularization.

The task of classification is one of the key tasks of machine learning, in which the model learns to determine the category to which the input object belongs. The main goal is to classify objects into previously known categories based on a set of features.

A basic example of a machine learning algorithm that solves the classification problem is logistic regression.

Quality metrics can be used to:
- Assignment of the error function (used during training).
- Selection of hyperparameters (used when measuring quality on cross-validation). In this case, you can use another metric that differs from the metric with which the error functional is constructed.
- Evaluation of the final model: whether the model is suitable for solving the problem.
